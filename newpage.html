    <h3>1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const?</h3>
    <li>
        <ul>
        var:
<ol>
    Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the function where they are declared.</ol>
<ol>If a variable is declared with var outside any function, it becomes a global variable, accessible throughout the entire program.</ol>
<ol>var variables are hoisted to the top of their scope during the compilation phase, so One can use them before they are declared (but their value will be undefined).</ol>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            let:
<ol>
  
Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) where they are defined.</ol>
<ol>Unlike var, let variables are not hoisted to the top of their scope, and they throw a ReferenceError if accessed before declaration.</ol>

        </ul>
        <ul>
        const:

    
  
   

<ol>  const is also block-scoped like let.</ol>
<ol> The key difference is that once a variable is declared with const, its value cannot be reassigned.</ol>
<ol>  However, it's important to note that for objects and arrays declared with const, the properties or elements of the object or array can still be modified.</ol>
        </ul>








    </li>


    <h3>2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined?</h3>
    <li>
        <ul>
           (i) undefined:
<ol>
    A variable is undefined when it has been declared but has not been assigned a value.</ol>
    Use cases:

<ol>Default values for function parameters.</ol>
<ol>To check if a variable has been assigned a value.</ol>
<ol>When an object property or array element may or may not exist, and you want to check its existence.</ol>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            null:
<ol>
  
    null is an assignment value that represents the intentional absence of any object value.</ol>
    Use cases:
<ol>Explicitly indicating the absence of a value</ol>
<ol>Resetting or clearing a variable</ol>
<ol>As a placeholder for an object property or variable whose value will be assigned later</ol>
</ul>  
<h3>3.What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
<ul>
    
REST API, or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless communication between clients and servers, typically using HTTP, and follows principles such as a uniform interface, statelessness, and resource-based interactions. REST APIs enable systems to communicate over the internet, allowing the exchange of data in a standardized and scalable way.
